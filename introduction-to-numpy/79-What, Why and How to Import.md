* Importing NumPy

### What is NumPy?

* NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
* It is an open - source Python library.

### Use of NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for working with numerical data in Python, and it has a wide range of applications. Some of the main uses of NumPy include:
* Numerical computing: NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numerical data, as well as functions to perform mathematical operations on these arrays, such as linear algebra, statistical analysis, and other mathematical functions.
* 
* Data manipulation and cleaning: NumPy provides functions for manipulating and cleaning data, such as sorting, reshaping, and aggregating data, as well as functions for reading and writing data to and from external file formats.
* 
* Machine learning and data science: NumPy is an essential library for many machine learning and data science applications, as it provides support for efficient numerical computations and manipulations of data. It is often used in conjunction with other libraries, such as SciPy and Pandas, to build powerful data analysis pipelines.
* 
* Scientific simulations and modeling: NumPy is widely used in scientific and engineering applications, as it provides support for fast numerical computations and data manipulations. It is often used to build simulations and models in fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology.

### Why NumPy?

* Makes the numerical computations easier and faster
* Consumes less memory

### Import NumPy

Anytime you want to use a library in Python, your first priority should be to make it accessible.

You can import/load NumPy in your notebook or any other Python IDE in two different ways.

**`import numpy`** \
OR \
**`import numpy as np`**

We will be using **np** shorthand for numpy. It simply serves as an alias and it is easier to use np instead writing full form ‘numpy’ while coding.

Note: In this bootcamp, we will use `import numpy as np`.
