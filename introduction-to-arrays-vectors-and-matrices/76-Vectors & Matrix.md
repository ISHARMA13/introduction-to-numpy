* Vector
* Matrix

### Vector

* A vector, in programming, is a type of array that is one-dimensional.

* For example, \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a vector.

Here's a simple explanation of what it means for a vector to be one-dimensional:

Imagine you have a box with a bunch of toy cars inside. You can think of the box as an array, and each toy car as an element in the array. An array is like a list of things that are organized in a specific order.

Now, imagine that you only have one row of toy cars in your box. This means that the toy cars are all lined up in a single row, like this:

car 1, car 2, car 3, car 4, car 5

This is a one-dimensional array, or a vector, because there is only one row of toy cars. In other words, the array has only one dimension, or direction.

In contrast, if you had a box with multiple rows of toy cars, like this:

car 1, car 2, car 3
car 4, car 5, car 6
car 7, car 8, car 9

Then this would be a two-dimensional array, because it has two dimensions, or directions (up and down, as well as left and right).

### Matrix

* Matrix is an arrangement of numbers into rows and columns.

* The matrix A has two rows and three columns.

### Shape of Matrix

* Since matrix A has two rows and three columns, we write its shape as $2 \times 3$, pronounced as ‘two by three’.

### Dimension of Matrix

* The shape of the matrix also tells you its dimensions. The dimension of matrix A is 2 as its shape is 2 $ \times $ 3.
* If a matrix has a shape, say, $2 \times 3 \times 2$, the dimension of the matrix would be 3.
* Don’t worry if you don’t get this point. It will become clearer as you go along.

### Matrix

* Matrix B has three rows and two columns, so it is a $3 \times 2$ matrix

* Whenever you are working with matrix shape, remember rows $\times$ columns.

Both vectors and matrices are useful for organizing and storing data, and they can be used in different ways to solve problems. For example, you could use a vector to keep track of the scores in a game, or you could use a matrix to represent the positions of objects on a screen.
